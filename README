When someone visits the website, the url gets checked in urls.py, if url is found
it passes the HTTPResponse that is returned by the function that has been assigned to that url or route

Now inside an HTTPResponse, we can pass HTML code, which are called as templates

Model --> Template -->View

User comes, urls get checked, if url present , it's view function gets called which returns a template in response
